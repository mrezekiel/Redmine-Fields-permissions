Forked this plug in to make a minor change and keep it in a repository for use later.
I have only changed the english parts.

Original is at https://github.com/resilva/Redmine-Fields-permissions

Fields permissions plugin allow you to enable or disable the view of 3 fields in the workflow, fields can be disabled :

- Assigned to
- Due date
- Start date (added by me)
- Estimated hours

With this plugins you can now disable these fields for some users or groups, it's useful because customer don't have the necessity to set these information and it's needed by managers and developers.
